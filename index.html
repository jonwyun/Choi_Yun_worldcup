                About Portugal
                Portugal, officially the Portuguese Republic (Portuguese: República Portuguesa [ʁɛˈpuβlikɐ puɾtuˈɣezɐ]),[note 4] is a country whose mainland is located on the Iberian Peninsula of Southwestern Europe, and whose territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira. It features the westernmost point in continental Europe, and its Iberian portion is bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain, the sole country to have a land border with Portugal. Its two archipelagos form two autonomous regions with their own regional governments. Lisbon is the capital and largest city by population.

                About Soccer Team 
                Portugal have one of the strongest squads for the World Cup this year, with the team having incredible depth. This will be one of the finest opportunities for Ronaldo to lead his side to immortality. Portugal are seeded in Group H along with Uruguay, Ghana, and South Korea. Although it is not an easy group, Portugal will undoubtedly win the group, given the richness of their squad. Otherwise, it will be seen as a massive waste for the nation.
